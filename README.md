# Sorting Algorithms
This is a collection of my own implementations of classic sorting algorithms, written in C. I wrote these to improve my own understanding of these algorithms, and their implementations.

The algorithms are: 

	- Bubble Sort
	- Quick Sort // Not started
	- Insertion Sort // Not started
	- Heap Sort // Not started
	- Merge Sort // Not Started
	- Selection Sort // Not Started
	

// This will be updated over time
